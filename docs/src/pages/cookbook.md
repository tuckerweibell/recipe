The Recipe Cookbook is a collection of examples to show how combinations of Recipe components can be composed like lego-blocks to build complete pages.

The cookbook is be comprised of examples of pages that are based on the of real design mockups our designers have created for screens our squads are building.

The purpose of the cookbook is two-fold:

- provide a reference guide of the common patterns of component usage needed to build pages
- guide our road-map by tackling emerging designs
