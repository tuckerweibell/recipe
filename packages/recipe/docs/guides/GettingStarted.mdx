# Getting Started

## Why Recipe?

- Recipe is ezCater's homegrown design system. It provides shared React components accompanied by documentation and design resources.
- A design system makes it easier to create a consistent and high-quality experience for our users. People trust interfaces that are easy to use and understand and have a polished and refined visual design. An interface with confusing or inconsistent elements or one that looks generic or unfinished reduces trust and credibility.
- A design system helps teams go faster by promoting reuse and minimizing the need for custom styling.
- A design system helps with brand recognition. People should be able to immediately recognize that an interface belongs to the ezCater brand or to a specific product in ezCater's product suite.
- If you want to learn more about the rationale for building a design system, here's a link to the [original proposal deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F2g0puThyfdYNwKYHGFNFiBNN3Lh7RHWxSfECG9MrUg/edit?usp=sharing).

## Components overview

- A good place to start is by reading the overview of how to do [high level screen layout](/components/ez-app-layout) with Recipe.
- Most Recipe components are opinionated about how to layout their child content. However in some cases you may need to use [Layout](/components/ez-layout) to control the horizontal layout of individual components across multiple breakpoints.
- If you want to see what's available in Recipe, you can [browse all components](/components/).
- Recipe components use consistent patterns for properties; you'll find various components use similarly named properties like `title` or `value` when the usage is equivalent across the components. Certain properties will also have a consistent shape wherever they are found. For example, the `breadcrumb` and `tabs` properties on [Page Header](/components/ez-page-header) and the `home` and `links` properties on [Navigation](/components/ez-navigation) accept a common "link" shaped object that accepts a url as an `href` or a [Router compatible Link](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Link).

## Considerations

Squads should challenge themselves to use the design system as much as possible. Designers should seek feedback on consistency and emerging patterns as a core aspect of design reviews. Engineers and PMs should ask questions if they see a proposed design that is not using Recipe.

However, Recipe is still a young design system and has plenty of room to evolve. We welcome ideas for new components and extensions of existing ones. We want to evolve the system in a thoughtful way so that we can main consistency.

Here are some things to consider when proposing a change to Recipe:

- Is this pattern general enough to apply to applications other than the one you are currently working on?
- Have you identified three or more situations where your proposed component could be used? These don't have to be all new cases, they could include situations where Recipe already has a solution but you think your proposed one is better for the user.
- Have you thought about the "distance" between this pattern and related patterns that are already in Recipe?
  - Can you provide clear guidance to designers and developers about when to choose this variation vs. the ones that are already available?
  - Will it be predictable to the user when they will see this variation vs. the ones that are already available?

## Recipe themes

[Recipe v14](/support/migrating-to-recipe-14) introduces extendable [Material UI](https://mui.com/) themes using [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction). As new components are introduced and current components are updated, they will use these supported themes. A future version of Recipe will remove all legacy themes once all components have migrated to using these themes.

### Supported themes

- `ezTheme`
- `ezMarketplaceTheme` - extends `ezTheme`
- `ezFulfillmentTheme` - extends `ezTheme`

### Theme provider

To use, wrap your Recipe components in the `EzThemeProvider` component and pass in the appropriate theme. This is usually done at the app level, but can be nested if needed.

```tsx
import {EzThemeProvider, EzButton, themes} from  '@ezcater/recipe';

const App = () => (
  <EzThemeProvider theme={themes.ezMarketplaceTheme}>
    <EzButton use="primary">Click me</EzButton>
  </EzProvider>
);
```

### Extending themes

<EzAlert
  headline="Warning"
  tagline="Extending themes can make future upgrade paths more difficult and should only be done when there is a valid use case to do so. If you'd like to suggest a change to a supported theme, please reach out to the Recipe team."
  use="warning"
></EzAlert>

We recognize there may be instances where extending a theme is necessary. For example, your app may require context-specific styles that are not supported by Recipe. In these cases, you can create a new customized emotion theme by extending a supported theme.

```tsx
import {EzThemeProvider, EzButton, themes} from '@ezcater/recipe';

const customTheme = themes.createTheme(themes.ezTheme, {
  // theme overrides here
});

const App = () => (
  <EzThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
    <EzButton use="primary">Click me</EzButton>
  </EzProvider>
);
```

Note: Recipe's supported themes extend MUI's [default theme](https://mui.com/customization/default-theme/), which uses the following theme configuration variables: `breakpoints`, `direction`, `components`, `palette`, `spacing`, `mixins`, `shadows`, `typography`, `transitions`, `zIndex`.

<EzAlert
  headline="Warning"
  tagline="Overwriting these configuration variables may result in unexpected behavior or change how the theme functions."
  use="warning"
></EzAlert>

### Importing theme properties

```tsx
import {themes} from '@ezcater/recipe';
import {styled} from '@emotion/react';

const {ezTheme} = themes;

const MyComponent = styled.div`
  color: ${ezTheme.palette.common.primary100};
`;

// Also available as an emotion theme prop

const MyOtherComponent = styled.div`
  color: ${({theme}) => theme.palette.common.primary100};
`;
```

### Including Recipe's default font

To ensure Recipe's default font is available in a webpage, copy this code into the `<head>` of your HTML document.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

## Design setup

The matching Sketch symbol library for Recipe is available through a tool called [Abstract](https://www.abstract.com/). Contact [the Recipe design team](/meet-the-team#recipe-design-team) if you have any questions about accessing it.

## Development setup

### Installation

```term
npm install @ezcater/recipe
```

or

```term
yarn add @ezcater/recipe
```

Aside from React and React DOM, Recipe has no other `peerDependencies`. Once `@ezcater/recipe` is installed, you're ready to start importing components!

### Server-side rendering (SSR)

If your app uses server-side rendering (SSR), you will need to add some additional configuration to support hydration by passing in the CSS string from [stitches](https://stitches.dev/docs/server-side-rendering) using a `<style />` tag.

Here's an example of SSR with Next.js:

```js
import React from 'react';
import NextDocument, {Html, Head, Main, NextScript} from 'next/document';
import {stitches} from '@ezcater/recipe';

export default class Document extends NextDocument {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html lang="en">
        <Head>
          <style id="stitches" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: stitches.getCssText()}} />
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}
```

### Importing components in your projects

Import the Recipe package, just as you would any other package dependency:

```js
import {EzButton} from '@ezcater/recipe';

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <EzButton use="primary" onClick={() => alert('You clicked me!')}>
      Click Me!
    </EzButton>
  </div>
);
```

---

### Updating to new releases

To install or update to the [latest version of Recipe](/changelog) in your application, run the following command:

```term
npm install @ezcater/recipe@latest
```

or

```term
yarn add @ezcater/recipe@latest
```

---

## Browser support

We strive for Recipe to have feature parity across all modern browsers.

**IE11 is no longer supported as of Recipe v14**. For applications that wish to run Recipe v13 or earlier in IE11, polyfills are required for the following browser features:

- [`Object.entries()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries)
- [`Element.prototype.closest()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/closest)
- [`Element.prototype.scrollTo()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollTo)
- [`CSS custom properties`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
- [`Array.prototype.findIndex()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex)

We recommend using [Polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/) in your application to apply necessary polyfills only when they are needed for the requesting browser.

### Polyfill.​io Example

```html
<script
  src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es2016%2Cdefault%2Ces2017%2Ces2015%2Csmoothscroll"
  type="text/javascript"
>
```
