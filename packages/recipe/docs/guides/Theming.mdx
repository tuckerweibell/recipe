# Theming

As of [Recipe v14](/support/migrating-to-recipe-14/), Emotion themes are now supported, making Recipe more flexible and adaptable, allowing downstream apps to use themes to utilize Recipe components more effectively.

Recipe themes are extended from the [MUI default theme](https://mui.com/customization/default-theme/) and represent a single source of truth for supported theme properties. If there is a specific use case for doing so, these themes can be further extended.

<EzAlert
  headline="Warning"
  tagline="Extending themes can make future upgrade paths more difficult and should only be done when there is a valid use case to do so. If you'd like to suggest a change to a supported theme, please reach out to the Recipe team."

    xlarge: 60px;
  `}
/>

## Layering

Recipe uses `z-index` sparingly, as this can cause maintenance issues with [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context) within Recipe and in downstream applications. In some cases, we carefully use `z-index` values to properly layer components like modals. Recipe mirrors the [MUI `z-index` values](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/z-index/) to avoid conflicts with components that were implemented with MUI. While you can override `z-index`, it is discouraged because it will likely have cascading effects.

This theme's currently specified `z-index` values:

<Source
  language="jsx"
  code={dedent`
    EzAutosuggest: 1350;
    EzDateInput: 1350;
    EzModal: 1300;
    EzPopover: 1350;
    EzSelect: 1350;
    EzTimeInput: 1350;
    EzTooltip: 1500;
  `}
/>
