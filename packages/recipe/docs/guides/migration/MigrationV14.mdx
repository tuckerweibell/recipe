# Migration to Recipe 14

## Prologue

Version 14 of Recipe introduces [Material UI](https://mui.com/) which reintroduces [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction), a css-in-js library that was removed in Version 12 in favor of [stitches](https://stitches.dev/) to support IE11, static extraction, and dependency management. This had some drawbacks related to exposing and extending themes, the ease of contributing, and ability to use third-party component implementations. Additionally, we no longer support IE11 or the future possibility of Recipe in Rails.

With the decisions to deprecate IE11 and Recipe in Rails support and to integrate third-party component implementations (like Material UI), new and existing components are being converted to emotion. During this process, current stitches-styled components will be supported until all components have been converted, at which point all stitches-related themes and styles will be deprecated.

As part of the emotion conversion, we are introducing the following emotion themes:

- `ezTheme`
- `ezMarketplaceTheme` - extends `ezTheme`
- `ezFulfillmentTheme` - extends `ezTheme`

You will now be able to extend themes, when there is a legitimate use case to do so, as well as import theme properties for use in other parts of your app, having access to supported colors, fonts, spacing, and other theme-related styles.

This release is a **major version release** and as such, **will require migration steps** for applications that currently use Recipe Version 13.x or below.

## Breaking Changes

The following changes are considered breaking changes:

1. IE11 is not compatible with current versions of Material UI and emotion, and is therefore no longer supported as of Recipe v14.

2. In order for emotion theme extensions to work correctly, your app and Recipe need to be using the same major version of emotion. Currently Recipe is using Version 11. If you are using Version 10 of emotion or below, you will need to [upgrade emotion to Version 11](https://emotion.sh/docs/emotion-11) as part of this migration.

3. In order for Recipe components to access the new themes, they will need to be wrapped in the `EzThemeProvider` component and passed the appropriate theme. This is usually done at the app level, but can be nested if needed. <br /> <br />

   ```js
   import {EzThemeProvider, EzButton, themes} from  '@ezcater/recipe';

   const App = () => (
     <EzThemeProvider theme={themes.ezMarketplaceTheme}>
       <EzButton use="primary">Click me</EzButton>
     </EzProvider>
   );
   ```

4. Deprecated legacy themes in Recipe have been removed. This includes the `standard` theme, which has been deprecated since Recipe v11, and was pulling in styles from the deprecated `@recipe-ui/legacy-theme` package. If you use these themes, you will need to do one of the following as part of this migration:
   - Update all affected themes to use one of the new supported themes: `ezTheme`, `ezMarketplaceTheme`, or `ezFulfillmentTheme`.
   - Update all affected themes to use the provided, but deprecated, `ezLegacyTheme`, which includes all legacy colors. It is recommended to use this theme if you still need to support using these legacy colors.
   - If you must continue to use legacy themes other than colors, you will need to use the legacy themes directly from the deprecated packages `@recipe-ui/legacy-theme` or `@recipe-ui/theme-marketplace`. While these packages will not be removed, they are deprecated and not supported by Recipe. We recommend you move all your themes over to use the new supported themes as soon as possible.

## Extending Themes

  <EzAlert
    headline="Warning"
    tagline="Extending themes can make future upgrade paths more difficult and should only be done when there is a valid use case to do so. If you'd like to suggest a change to a supported theme, please reach out to the Recipe team."
    use="warning"
  />
</Unstyled>

We recognize there may be instances where extending a theme is necessary. For example, your app may require context-specific styles that are not supported by Recipe. In these cases, you can create a new customized emotion theme by extending a supported theme.

```tsx
import {EzThemeProvider, EzButton, themes} from '@ezcater/recipe';

const customTheme = themes.createTheme(themes.ezTheme, {
  // theme overrides here
});

const App = () => (
  <EzThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
    <EzButton use="primary">Click me</EzButton>
  </EzProvider>
);
```

Note: Recipe's supported themes extend MUI's [default theme](https://mui.com/customization/default-theme/), which uses the following theme configuration variables: `breakpoints`, `direction`, `components`, `palette`, `spacing`, `mixins`, `shadows`, `typography`, `transitions`, `zIndex`.

<Unstyled>
  <EzAlert
    headline="Warning"
    tagline="Overwriting these configuration variables may result in unexpected behavior or change how the theme functions."
    use="warning"
  />
</Unstyled>

## Importing Theme Properties

Recipe themes act as a source of truth for all supported theme properties, such as color, fonts, spacing, and other theme-related styles. You can import these theme properties for use in other parts of your app.

```tsx
import {themes} from '@ezcater/recipe';
import {styled} from '@emotion/react';

const {ezTheme} = themes;

const MyComponent = styled.div`
  color: ${ezTheme.palette.common.primary100};
`;

// Also available as an emotion theme prop

const MyOtherComponent = styled.div`
  color: ${({theme}) => theme.palette.common.primary100};
`;
```
