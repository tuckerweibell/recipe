# Migration to Recipe 18

Version 18 of Recipe updates includes moving our Gatsby doc site over to Storybook Docs as well as various theming changes.

This release is a **major version release** and as such, **will require migration steps** for applications that currently use Recipe Version 17.x or below.

## Breaking changes

The following changes are considered breaking changes:

### 1. Color names in `ezColors` are now color specific, not theme property specific

Recipe's set of global colors found in `themes/ezColors.ts` has renamed various colors to remove theme property names now that we have multiple themes using different color tokens for theme properties.

If using any of these colors directly, they will need to be updated to the new color names.

- **OLD => NEW**
- `alert110` => `red120`
- `alert100` => `red110`
- `alert90` => `red90`
- `alert80` => `red80`
- `neutral170` => `black`
- `neutral160` => `grey160`
- `neutral150` => `grey150`
- `neutral140` => `grey140`
- `neutral130` => `grey130`
- `neutral120` => `grey120`
- `neutral110` => `grey110`
- `neutral100` => `white`
- `primary120` => `green120`
- `primary110` => `green110`
- `primary100` => `green100`
- `primary90` => `green90`
- `success100` => `green103`
- `success90` => `green95`
- `warning110` => `orange110`
- `warning100` => `orange100`
- `warning90` => `orange90`
- `warning80` => `orange80`
- `blue90` => `blue70`
- `yellow110` => `yellow100`
- `yellow100` => `yellow90`

```js
// Example change
