# Versioning

## Changelog Entries

The changelog is prepared manually immediately before a release. Each changelog entry should follow the [Angular commit message convention](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-automate-project-versioning-and-releases-with-continuous-deployment/#commit-format), using the following groups to categorize changes:

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Introduces a breaking API change (removal of a component/prop, type restrictions etc)
- **feat**: New components, new variations, accessibility improvements, etc
- **fix**: Bug fixes
- **perf**: A code change that improved performance
- **style**: Design updates (non-breaking design changes implemented in code)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
- **docs**: Documentation only changes (including content, layout or build)
- **deps**: Updates to package dependencies (excluding developer tool dependencies)
- **workflow**: Development workflow related changes (build/test scripts and dependencies)
- **test**: Add missing tests or corrections to existing ones
