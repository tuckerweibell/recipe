# EzTable

Tables are used to display information from a data set in a way that's easy to scan, allowing users to compare and analyze the data to look for patterns and insights. Tables will often be the primary content within an [EzCard](?path=/docs/surface-ezcard--docs).

Features still in consideration include:

- Responsive variants (cards with repeated labels, transpose table)
- Column pinning to support horizontal scrolling
- Column width options (grow, auto, ellipsis, tooltip)
- Header-less columns (content between columns, e.g. formula operators)
- Sticky headers

## Props

## Best practices

Tables should:

- Be used to show homogeneous content.
- Help users visualize values from a data set.
- Only display values supporting the data's purpose.
- Include a heading to help identify the contents of the table at-a-glance.
- Provide links to view additional or related content within the first column of a table.

### Alignment

Column content types can be varied using component props to enable the following alignment rules:

- Numerical values should be right aligned
- Textual values should be left aligned
- Headers (where present) should align with their data

### Content guidelines

Tables should:

- Include concise but descriptive headers
- Avoid truncating content where possible

Tables can also:

- Support items that perform an action when clicked. For example, navigating to the item's details page or provide more detail about the item.
- Provide bulk actions for tasks that are applicable to many items at once.

## Simple

Use simple tables whenever the tabular data is directly related to the preceding or subsequent content. Simple tables should be used as a direct child of an [EzCard](?path=/docs/surface-ezcard--docs) component.

- `columns` (required array)

  - `key` (string): The key of the column.
  - `heading` (required string): The heading of the column.
  - `icon` (ReactNode | ComponentType): An optional icon appending the heading of the column.
  - `numeric` (boolean): If true, the column is right aligned.
  - `width` (number): The width of the column.
  - `component` (ReactNode | ComponentType): See [Interactive cells](#interactive-cells).
  - `sortable` (boolean): See [Sortable tables](#sortable).
  - `defaultSort` (`asc | desc`): See [Sortable tables](#sortable).

- `items` (required array): Made up of `key: value` pairs where the `key` matches a `key` from a given `column`.

<Canvas of={SimpleStories.Simple} meta={SimpleStories} />

### `fullWidth`

Add the `fullWidth` property to allow a simple table to fill the parent element's width.

<Canvas of={SimpleStories.SimpleFullWidth} meta={SimpleStories} />

## Composite

Composite tables are composed inside a card and typically include a table header. Use composite tables whenever the tabular data alone represents a cohesive set of content.

- `title` (required string) The title of the table.
- `titleIcon` (ReactNode): The title icon of the table.
- `actions` (ReactNode): Actions that operate on the data or are related to the content. Multiple actions can be wrapped in an [EzLayout](?path=/docs/layout-ezlayout--docs) to manage responsiveness.

<Canvas of={CompositeStories.Composite} meta={CompositeStories} />

### `showCardWithoutHeading`

If the tabular data alone represents a cohesive set of content without a table card heading, you may use `showCardWithoutHeading` to remove the heading. May include optional actions.

To maintain accessibility, provide an `ariaLabel` and optionally a heading or label above the card.

<Canvas of={CompositeStories.CompositeNoHeading} meta={CompositeStories} />

### `transparent`

Add the `transparent` property to inherit the parent element's background color.

<Canvas of={CompositeStories.CompositeTransparent} meta={CompositeStories} />

## Interactive

Tables can be used in a variety of ways allowing users to interact with the data.

### Interactive cells

Custom cell rendering is supported to give more control over table content, such as providing interactive links or buttons. To do so, provide a `component` property (of type `ReactNode` or `ComponentType`) to the given column. Custom components will be provided an `item` property with the item to be rendered.

<Canvas of={InteractiveStories.InteractiveCell} meta={InteractiveStories} />

### Interactive rows

Custom cell rendering can also be used to make the entire row interactive, ensuring the click surface of the link spans the entire table row.

The `component` property of a column is provided a `linkRef` property which allows the table to target specific links to trigger when the table row is clicked. The `linkRef` prop should only be applied to a single column's component, as clicking the row should trigger navigation on a single link.

Ideally, [only the first column](#best-practices) of the table should provide links to view additional or related content.

<Canvas of={InteractiveStories.InteractiveRow} meta={InteractiveStories} />

## Pagination

Pagination can be used to display a large data set, either local or remote, with a set number of rows per page. To enable, provide the `pagination` property to `EzTable` with the following:

- `currentPage` (required 1-indexed integer): The default starting page for the data set.
- `onNextPageClick` (required function): Callback fired when the "Next Page" link is clicked.
- `onPrevPageClick` (required function): Callback fired when the "Previous Page" link is clicked.
- `onRowsPerPageChange` (required function): Callback fired when the "n rows per page" select value is changed.
- `rowsPerPage` (required integer): How many items to show per page.
- `rowsPerPageOptions` (required array of integers): Options displayed to change `rowsPerPage`.
- `totalFilteredRows` (optional integer): The number of rows after data has been filtered, if using a filter. See [Filtering](#filtering).
- `totalRows` (required integer): The total number of items in the data set.

<Canvas of={PaginationStories.Pagination} meta={PaginationStories} />

## Sortable

Use column sorting to help users find items quicker in larger data sets. Table data can only be sorted by a single column at a time.

EzTable:

- `onSortClick` (required function): Callback called when a column header is pressed. Provided with `column` metadata and the `direction` in which to sort the data, either `asc` for ascending (default) or `desc` for descending.

EzTable columns:

- `sortable` (boolean): If true, the column is sortable.
- `defaultSort` (`asc | desc`): The sort order applied to pre-sorted column data.

<Canvas of={SortableStories.Sortable} meta={SortableStories} />

### Sorting with pagination

Sorting can also be used with pagination.

<Canvas of={SortableStories.SortablePagination} meta={SortableStories} />

## Selectable

Use selectable tables when multiple rows of a table can be selected together to perform an action in bulk. The user can select or deselect either individual rows from a data set, or all the rows in the table.

Required `selection` options:

- `isRowSelected` (required function): A function returning a boolean used to determine if a row item is currently marked as selected. Accepts the row's `item` object as an argument.
- `onBulkSelectClick` (required function): Callback fired when the user clicks the row header checkbox in the table, affecting all currently visible rows.
- `onRowSelectClick` (required function): Callback fired when the user clicks a row checkbox in the table. Provided with the click `event` and the `item` metadata selected.

<Canvas of={SelectableStories.Selectable} meta={SelectableStories} />

### Selectable rows with pagination

When using pagination, users can select or deselect all or a subset of rows from any page. When a selection is made, options are presented to select or deselect all rows across all pages of the data set.

<Unstyled>
  <EzAlert
    headline="Warning"
    tagline="Using bulk selection across pages may interact with your custom actions in an unexpected way (for example, with a search filter). Be sure to test all logic to ensure everything works as expected."
    use="warning"
  />
</Unstyled>

Optional `selection` options:

- `disableMultiPageSelection` (boolean): If true, the user will not be able to select all rows across pages.
- `onSelectAllClick` (function): Callback fired when the "Select all" message is clicked.
- `onSelectNoneClick` (function): Callback fired when the "Clear selection" message is clicked.
- `totalRowsSelected` (number): Total number of total rows selected across pages.

<Canvas of={SelectableStories.SelectablePagination} meta={SelectableStories} />

## Filtering

A search input can be used in the header to filter table data. Provide an `EzSearchInput` as an action, with a corresponding search term and function to handle filtering the data.

<Unstyled>
  <EzAlert
    headline="Warning"
    tagline="Be careful when filtering search large data sets which can result in poor performance."
    use="warning"
  />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={FilteringStories.Filtering} meta={FilteringStories} />

### Advanced filtering

Multiple filters can be used across pages to filter a data set in a table. To avoid performance degradation:

- Do not use client-side filtering for large data sets (hundreds or more entries) as it can make the table unusable.
- Prefer making server-side API calls to filter the actual data set as the client-side filters change, with appropriate [debouncing](https://www.developerway.com/posts/debouncing-in-react) based on the situation.
