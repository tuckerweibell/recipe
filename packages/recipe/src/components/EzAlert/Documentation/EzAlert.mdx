# EzAlert

Alerts represent highlighted messages on a page that call out important information. Alerts can be used both inline with page content as well as a subheader as a status for the entire page.

<Primary />

## Props

<Controls of={DefaultStories.Default} sort="requiredFirst" />

## Best Practices

### Alerts should:

- Be brief
- Communicate a clear message to highlight to customers
- Emphasize the action within the headline, and save the tagline for further explanation or additional information
- Be positioned in consistent locations
- Not wrap `headline` text - for maximum legibility, use the `tagline` property for additional information

### Alerts should not:

- Be used too often - they are meant to highlight important information and will be drowned out if used too frequently on a single page

## Alert Uses

Alerts have various uses depending on the information you are trying to convey. Use the `use` prop to define the alert's use.

- `success`: Success alerts are used to highlight information that was generated by a successful / confirmed action.
- `error`: Error alerts are used to highlight information that was generated by an unsuccessful action or error that needs to be remedied.
- `warning`: Warning alerts are used to highlight information that was generated by a warning or caution the user to proceed carefully going forward.
- `info` (default): Info alerts are used to highlight general information and provide more context for the surrounding content.
- `tip`: Tip alerts are used to highlight tips and other helpful information or materials.
- `marketing`: Marketing alerts are used to highlight product marketing information or materials.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={UseStories.Success} meta={UseStories} />
  <Story of={UseStories.Error} meta={UseStories} />
  <Story of={UseStories.Warning} meta={UseStories} />
  <Story of={UseStories.Info} meta={UseStories} />
  <Story of={UseStories.Tip} meta={UseStories} />
  <Story of={UseStories.Marketing} meta={UseStories} />
</Canvas>

## Alert without a tagline

Alerts do not require taglines and can be rendered with just a headline.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={NoTaglineStories.NoTagline} meta={NoTaglineStories} />
</Canvas>

## Directional Alerts

Alerts can be tied to other content via a directional speech bubble arrow either above or below content.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={DirectionalStories.Bottom} meta={DirectionalStories} />
  <Story of={DirectionalStories.Top} meta={DirectionalStories} />
</Canvas>
