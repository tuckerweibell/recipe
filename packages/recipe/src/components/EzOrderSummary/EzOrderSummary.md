## Best Practices

Order summaries should:

- Show pricing information across various line items
- Minimize clutter by only including values relevant to the data's purpose.
- Include a totals section to surface a summary of the values that factor into the total for the order. This should include any added costs or discounts applied to the order, such as taxes, delivery charges, coupons and/or gift cards.
- Be used within an [Page](/components/ez-page)
- Clearly identify the Order by providing a title when using optional actions, such that the target of the action is clear.

Order summaries should not:

- Be used for an actionable list. Line items should not link to details pages.
- Be used to present the Order without prices/totals (i.e for order prep)
- Be nested within a [Card](/components/ez-card). An order summary represents a cohesive set of content and should not be grouped with other card content.
