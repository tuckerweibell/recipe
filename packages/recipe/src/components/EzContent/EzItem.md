The Item component represents an item in a list or collection. Item provides no specific styling by itself, but receives styling from the parent container. In addition, Item elements will be automatically placed within the container's layout, according to the parent container's positioning guidelines.

See EzField's [Mulitple choice fields](/components/ez-field#multiple-choice-input-field-with-nested-content) example for an idea of how to use the Item component in the context of a list.
