The Content component represents a section of content within a Recipe container such as a Dialog or Card. Content provides no specific styling by itself, but receives styling from the parent container. In addition, Content will be automatically placed within the container's layout, according to the parent container's positioning guidelines.

See [Card](/components/ez-card) for examples of how to use the Content component in the context of a Recipe container. See MDN for more information about the semantics of the [section element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section), which is used internally by the Content component.

## Example

### Content

```jsx
<EzContent>This content should be used as body content by its parent container component</EzContent>
```
