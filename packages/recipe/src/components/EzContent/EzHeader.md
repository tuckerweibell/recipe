The Header component represents a introductory content, typically a title, but may also include navigation link and easy to reach actions. Header provides no specific styling by itself, but receives styling from the parent container. In addition, Header will be automatically placed within the container's layout, according to the parent container's positioning guidelines.

See [Card](/components/ez-card) for examples of how to use the Header component in the context of a Recipe container. See MDN for more information about the semantics of the [header element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header), which is used internally by the Header component.
