# EzFlashMessage

<MigrationAlert component="ez-flash-message" />

Flash messages are used to display contextual messages related to content on the page. This could be an action that was just performed by the user or an action that should be taken by the user.

<Primary />

## Props

<Controls of={DefaultStories.Default} sort="requiredFirst" />

## Best practices

Flash message should:

- Be concise
- Include only paragraphs of text
- Use the `headline` attribute when the content of the message is large enough that it could benefit from an easy to scan headline.

Flash messages should not:

- Be stacked. This can confuse and dilute the importance of each message.

## Content guidelines

Flash messages should contain relevant information related to the current state of the page. This should only be conveyed via text; no images should be added within the container of the flash message.

## Success flash message

Positive feedback and new things! Let's the user know that something good has happened.

Use for:

- Success/Completion
- Positive message
- Trending upward
- Above average trends
- On-time/Ahead of schedule

```jsx
<EzPage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="success">
    <p>We saved that for you. No further action required, just letting you know!</p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="success" headline="We saved that for you.">
    <p>
      No further action required, just letting you know! Your changes will take effect immediately.
    </p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
</EzPage>
```

## Error flash message

Super important. Let's the user know about high risk or high urgency messages.

Use for:

- High risk/urgency messaging
- Error/Failure
- Late/Overdue status
- Downward trends
- Unsatisfactory timelines
- Warning of irreversible actions

Seeing these banners can be stressful, use them judiciously.

```jsx
<EzPage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="error">
    <p>Oh Crumbs! It looks like that order time is no longer available.</p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="error" headline="Oh Crumbs!">
    <p>
      It looks like that order time is no longer available. There are 724 caterers that deliver to
      your address, but none are available to deliver at this time.
    </p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
</EzPage>
```

## Warning flash message

Current action needs attention. Used mid-way through a process to highlight risk or to indicate that further action is required.

Use for:

- Low risk/urgency messaging
- Pending status
- Below average (but stable) trends
- Partial completion

```jsx
<EzPage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="warning">
    <p>Something bad could occur if you do that. Not going to stop you, just letting you know!</p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="warning" headline="Minimum order size hasn't been met.">
    <p>
      This caterer has a minimum order size of $50 for free delivery. A delivery charge of $10 will
      apply to orders under this amount.
    </p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
</EzPage>
```

## Info flash message

Tips, guidance and advice. Used to highlight general information and provide more context for the surrounding content.

Use for:

- Helpful messages or usage tips
- Unread messages or notifications
- Average trends

```jsx
<EzPage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="info">
    <p>Please note, reviews can only be written for orders fulfilled in the past 45 days.</p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
  <EzFlashMessage use="info" headline="New delivery rates are now in effect.">
    <p>
      Give our Caterer Care team a call (555-555-5555) to learn more about how these changes affect
      your store.
    </p>
  </EzFlashMessage>
</EzPage>
```

## Dismissable flash message

Adding an `onDismiss` event handler will display an icon button in the top right hand corner of the flash message that can be used to dismiss the flash message. This state is local to the component in which the flash message is displayed.

Autohide flash messages should not be used with `onDismiss`.

```jsx
() => {
  const [visible, setVisible] = React.useState(true);

  React.useEffect(
    function reopenUponClosing() {
      const id = setTimeout(setVisible, 1000, true);
      return () => clearTimeout(id);
    },
    [visible]
  );

  return (
    <EzPage>
      {visible && (
        <EzFlashMessage
          use="success"
          headline="We saved that for you."
          onDismiss={() => setVisible(!visible)}
        >
          <p>
            No further action required, just letting you know! Your changes will take effect
            immediately.
          </p>
        </EzFlashMessage>
      )}
    </EzPage>
  );
};
```

## Autohide flash message

Adding an `autohide` flag will automatically hide the flash message after 5000ms, or a specified `autohideDuration`. Provide a `onAutohide` event handler for custom event handling when the flash message disappears.

For example, if an autohide flash message should only be viewed once (and not again on refresh), pass a custom function to `onAutohide` that handles persisting whether a message has been viewed or not.

Autohide flash messages should not be used with `onDismiss`.

```jsx
() => {
  return (
    <EzPage>
      <EzFlashMessage
        use="success"
        headline="We saved that for you."
        autohide
        autohideDuration={2000}
        onAutohide={() => console.log('Flash message hidden.')}
      >
        <p>
          No further action required, just letting you know! Your changes will take effect
          immediately.
        </p>
      </EzFlashMessage>
    </EzPage>
  );
};
```
